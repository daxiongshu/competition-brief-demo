Kagglers, you are doing great so far, and we are excited to see the improving   
RMSE on the leaderboard. In the comments on this post, I will share some helpful
tricks that geologists use to come up with the best interpretations.

GR from the lateral before the Prediction Start point has better resolution than
the GR from the type well.                                                      

If the well is going in the negative direction in the TVT domain from the       
Prediction Start point, then the correlation with the GR from the lateral will  
be better. Therefore, it is better to use the GR from the lateral before the    
Prediction Start point for the lateral GR correlation.                          

In my image, the red curve correlates better with the green curve than the type 
well (gray).

Lateral Well GR correlates on itself. Lateral Well GR has better resolution than
Typewell GR

Formation Dip (angle of the formation) from the nearby wells should be similar
